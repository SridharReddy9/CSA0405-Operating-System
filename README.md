## Experiment-3 :Design a CPU scheduling program with C using First Come First Served technique with the following considerations. 
a. All processes are activated at time 0. 
b. Assume that no process waits on I/O devices.

## Experiment-13: Construct a C program for implementation the various memory allocation strategies.
(https://github.com/SridharReddy9/CSA0405-Operating-System/blob/main/Experiment-13.cpp)
## Experiment-14: Construct a C program to organize the file using single level directory.
(https://github.com/SridharReddy9/CSA0405-Operating-System/blob/main/Experiment-14.cpp)
## Experiment-15: Design a C program to organize the file using two level directory structure.
## Experiment-16: Develop a C program for implementing random access file for processing the employee details.
